# Java Minesweeper played in CLI

- This game is made to be run in the command line of a java application
- It can be played when the program is run, and the game will start.
- Commands are shown within the game, where the user is asked for a column and row (X and Y) value, then the game updates checks that cell.
- Once the game is finished, either by beating the game or by hitting a mine, the user is asked if they want to play again.

# Purpose:

- The purpose of this project is to show my working knowledge of Java.
